# DISABLED: Webhook workflow - requires GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL secret
# Use the Python workflow instead: update-torn-wars-python.yml
#
# This workflow has been disabled because it requires a webhook URL that hasn't been set up.
# The Python workflow (update-torn-wars-python.yml) is working and will handle all updates.
#
# To re-enable this workflow:
# 1. Remove all comment symbols (#)
# 2. Set up the GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL secret in GitHub
# 3. Deploy the Google Apps Script webhook
